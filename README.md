# Business Case
The project focuses on analyzing the medical appointments dataset to gain insights into patient attendance behavior, particularly factors contributing to "no-show" appointments. These insights will help healthcare organizations optimize scheduling, reduce appointment no-shows, and improve patient engagement. By understanding patterns related to demographics, health conditions, and scheduling, the project aims to improve resource allocation, reduce inefficiencies, and enhance patient care.

# Goal
Identify Key Patterns in Appointment Attendance like

Examine trends in patient attendance (i.e., no-show rates) based on demographics (gender, age group), health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, etc.), and external factors (e.g., SMS reminders).

Understand the Impact of Age and Health Conditions on No-Show Rates

Utilize the insights from the analysis to help healthcare providers make data-driven decisions for scheduling and improve patient engagement strategies.

Identify the potential impact of reminders (SMS_received) on patient attendance and reduce the overall no-show rate.

# Deliverables

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Loading Data

Methods to identify and handle duplicates and missing values in the dataset.

Convert columns (ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay) to datetime objects.

Column Renaming

Data Transformation

Data Export
Using the cleaned data, the dataset is uploaded to a MySQL database with the table patients, containing the following columns: Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap, SMSReceived, NoShow, and Age_group.
SQL Queries for Analysis:

A series of SQL queries have been used to analyze the data, including counting values, calculating averages, determining monthly and weekly appointment distributions, identifying relationships with gender, and examining appointment timing.

Python code to clean and transform the data, including read_csv(), check_duplicates(), check_null_values(), rename_columns(), drop_columns(), create_bin(), drop(), convert(), and export_the_dataset().

# Results and Evaluation
Several SQL queries were executed to understand the distribution of appointments based on gender, weekdays, months, and the average time between scheduling and appointment day.

Most frequent appointment days and highest number of appointments were identified.

Average number of appointments per day and per week were calculated, helping to understand scheduling patterns.

A distribution of appointments based on gender was established, providing insights into the attendance behavior of male and female patients.

No-show trends and their correlation with health conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) were evaluated.

# Business Insights:
Insights from the analysis indicate that patients with certain health conditions (e.g., hypertension) had higher no-show rates.

Gender-based differences in no-show behavior were also observed, with males showing a slightly higher no-show rate than females.

SMS reminders proved to be a significant factor in reducing no-shows, with those receiving SMS reminders having lower no-show rates.

# Business Impact
Healthcare organizations can use the data to tailor communication strategies (e.g., more frequent reminders, follow-up calls) and improve patient engagement, ultimately leading to higher patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.

Reducing no-show rates and improving scheduling can lead to significant cost savings by ensuring that appointment slots are not wasted, thus optimizing the use of healthcare resources.

# Next Steps

Develop real-time monitoring and scheduling systems that adjust dynamically based on predicted no-shows and cancellations. This can further optimize the healthcare provider's resources.

Enhance the existing SMS reminder system by incorporating personalized reminders based on factors like age, health conditions, and appointment history to further reduce no-show rates.

Extend the analysis to include more granular data, such as geographic location or time-of-day patterns, to uncover additional trends that could improve scheduling and resource allocation.

Build a decision support system that combines historical trends, predictive analytics, and real-time data to help healthcare providers optimize patient flow, reduce costs, and improve the quality of care.
